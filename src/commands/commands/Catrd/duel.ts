                So... how does this work?
                
                Both duel participants will have now been sent a list of 7 cards, this is your hand.
                The game is turn based, the current turn is displayed at the bottom of the game board.
                The game board will be updated as the game progressing. Keep an eye on it.
                The game has 'rounds', and round ends when both users have passed.
    
                When it is your turn, playing a card is as simple as typing the name of the card into the channel where the board is.
                To pass just type 'pass' in the channel where the board is.
                If a user runs out of cards in their hand they will automatically pass.
                Once both users have passed, the user with the highest current total power on their side of the board will win the round. (This is the accumulative power of all the cards on their side)
                
                The total round wins can be seen at the top of the board next to the usernames.
                The total played power is at the bottom.

                Certain cards may have abilities that have side effects once played. 
                These will be marked in the hand you were sent. Run \`abilityinfo\` to check what an ability does (this works in dms).
                
                Whoever has the current turn may type \`refresh\` in the this channel to send a new message with the board.
                This is for longer duels so you don't have to scroll upwards as far.

                The first user to two round wins will win the overall game.
                Good luck!
